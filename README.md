# ðŸ”§ Smart Predictive Maintenance System

## Project Description

This project is a comprehensive, end-to-end machine learning solution designed to predict equipment failures before they occur. By leveraging time-series sensor data, it provides actionable insights to schedule maintenance proactively, reducing downtime and operational costs.

The system is built with a modular and scalable architecture, featuring a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that uses MongoDB as its primary data store. It automatically ingests raw data, trains multiple machine learning models, evaluates their performance, and saves predictions for real-time monitoring
